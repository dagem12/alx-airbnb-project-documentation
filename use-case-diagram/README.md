# Use Case Diagram â€” Airbnb Clone

This folder contains the use case diagram for the backend of the Airbnb Clone project. It shows how different users (actors) interact with the system for the main features like registering, booking properties and handling payments.

## ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s in the diagram

Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of the actors and what they can do:

- **Guest**
  - Register and log in
  - Search for property listings
  - Book properties
  - Make payments

- **Host**
  - Manage property listings
  - Manage bookings
  - Get payouts

- **Admin**
  - Manage users, listings, bookings, and payments from the admin dashboard

The "System" (backend API) handles all those actions in between.
